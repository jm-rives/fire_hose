			<i>My Third Life</i>
		</p>
		<p>
			I am a novice programmer and former nurse practitioner. I left clinical health care to pursue the knowledge and skills that will enable me to develop open source full stack software and data analysis tools that will empower patients and healthcare providers with new ways to improve health and wellness worldwide within 5 years.
